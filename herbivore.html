			<h1>Stable Isotopic Analysis</h1>
			<h3>What is an Isotope?</h3>
			<p>Isotopes are atoms that come from the same element, and have an equal number of protons and an unequal number of neutrons, which gives them a measurable weight.</p>
			<h4>There are Two Categories of Isotopes:</h4>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Radioactive Isotopes:</strong> decay over time.</dt>
				<dd>Archaeologist use radioactive isotopes, such as Carbon-14, for dating.  They can calculate an organic matterâ€™s decay rate overtime to obtain a rough date for when the decay first started.  Keep in mind that Radio Carbon dating has a margin of error of about 100 years, not too useful if you are examining anything less then a couple thousand years old.</dd>
				<dt><strong>Stable Isotopes:</strong> do not decay, and remain the same over time.</dt>
				<dd>These are the isotopes that get stored in our bodies as we develop and grow.  They are markers of the environment in which someone was raised, and they can provide archaeologist with a window into the diets and movements of the people to which they belong.  By measuring the ratio of certain stable isotopes found in skeletal remains, archaeologist can begin to pinpoint what kind of environment an individual may have grown up in and what was their diet.</dd>

			<h2>How are Stable Isotopes Useful?</h2>
			<h4>What can isotopes tell us about ancient diets?</h4>
			<p>Carbon and Nitrogen isotopes are the most common isotopes used for analyzing diet.  Carbon stable isotopes can be used to trace different types of plants by the environment in which they are grown.  For example, C3 is a common marker found in most land-based plants.  A critical exception to this is corn, which happens to be a C4, and coincidently, one of the most important early domestic crops in North America.  One of the first big isotopic analysis studies used these two isotopes types to examine the introduction of agriculture in North America.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Carbon stable isotopes are also most commonly found in land-based animals.  So a diet high in carbon stable isotopes, will mark a preference for terrestrial animals instead of marine animals.  Nitrogen isotope ratios can be used to determine the amount of animal products in a diet.</p>
