			<h4>What is Zoo-archaeology?</h4>
			<div id="carn-card1">
				<p>Zoo-archaeology, or faunal analysis, is the study of animal remains that have been found in an archaeological context.  This, most of the time, means studying the remains of animals that have been used as a source of food, but it also extends to the odd family pet, animals buried in a “ritual” context, and even the (<em>not so odd</em>) rodent that found its way into the food storage or disposal area.</p>
				<br>
				<p>For those of you envisioning the glamorous life style of treasure seeking archaeologist, I hate to burst your bubble, but professional archaeologist probably spend about 95% of their time digging though people’s trash.  Hundreds and thousands of years old trash, sure, <em>but still trash</em>.  They’ve even refer to these trash pits by a fancy name – midden.  One of the most prevalent artifacts recovered form these middens tend to be faunal remains.  The further back in time you go, the less organic matter is preserved.  This is why pre-historic archaeologist spend so much time studying ceramics and lithics.  Lithics, being rocks, have a greater chance of withstanding the tests of time, and ceramics break, making them readily disposed, and the target of many midden excavations.  Animal bones are also part of that disposable material culture, that given the right soil conditions, can tell archaeologists a lot about what people may have been subsisting on. </p>

			<h4>The Basics</h4>
			<div id="carn-card2">
				<p>Dependent on soil conditions, bioturbation (<em>a fancy word for outside, natural forces that might disturb the soil – think tree roots, tunneling moles, and rain run off</em>), and butchering/cooking practices, faunal remains often arrive for analysis in hundreds of tiny fragments.  It’s the job of the zoo-archaeologist to make some sense out of the mess.  In order to do this they follow a set of specific steps.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>First they sort out the fragments by vertebrate class; mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians.  As it so happens, mammals, birds, and fish each have a unique bone density, and with practice and experience can be easily identified as one or the other.  Reptiles and amphibians, in most cases, find there way into faunal collections through natural processes instead of human involvement.  But when you do find them they can be identified by their fairly unique bone structures</li>
					<li>Next they sort through the bones for any identifiable features that might provide clues as to the species or genus of the fragment.  This is the most labor-intensive part of the process.  During this time zoo-archaeologists also make note of which fragments show signs of human modification, things like burned bone or cut/butchery marks. Zoo-archaeologist use the quantifiable measurement of NISP, which stands for the number of identifiable specimens, to get a reading on what a particular faunal collection consists of.</li>
					<li>Zoo-archaeologist then assess the bones by species in the hopes of providing a possible MNI.  MNI stands for the Minimum Number of Individuals found for a specific species.  Say your faunal collection has 6 left deer femurs in it, then you can assume that there are at least 6 deer in your collection, and you can record an MNI of 6.</li>
					<li>Following the calculation of MNI, a zoo-archaeologist will further assess the bones for the animals age at death.  This is more pertinent to mammals, and can provide further clues as to seasonality and hunting/domesticating processes.</li>
					<li>Last, but not least, the bones all get weighted by category.  Which often includes categories by species, categories by vertebrate class, categories by human modification, and categories for the unidentifiable fragments.</li>
