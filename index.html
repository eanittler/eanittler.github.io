			<h2>The Importance of Food Throughout History</h2>
			<div id="omni_card1">
				<p>Food is one of the few universalities when it comes to being human.  It transcends both culture and time. The other two big ones being birth and death.  We are all born, we will all someday die, and we all need food to survive.  As it so happens, a lot of early material culture (a fancy term for human-made stuff) was geared toward the procurement and processing of food.  Projectile points from the Paleolithic for hunting, scrapers and grinding stones from the Neolithic for processing, and a long (<em>â€¦about 30,000 years long</em>) and diverse record of ceramic cooking and food storage vessels, are just a few examples of the food related detritus that archaeologist have spent decades excavating and studying. </p>
				<p>Archaeologists also have a long history of attributing significant cultural changes to new innovations in the procurement and production of food.  In fact, some physical anthropologists even attribute the evolution of early hominids to the development of a protein rich diet through the extraction of bone marrow and (<em>dare I say it</em>) the innovation of fire.  The transition from a nomadic hunter and gather society to a sedentary farming society is one of the biggest shifts a civilization can undergo, as far as archaeologiests are concerned, and it all comes down to food.  It is only through procuring a secure and steady supply of food that other areas of human innovation begin to flourish.  It is only then that we begin to see large scale public works projects being carried out (<em>think Stonehenge and the Pyramids</em>) and further diversification of skill sets (<em>think early stone masonry and metal working</em>). </p>
